# Neural Network Customization and Analysis
This repository contains custom implementations and comprehensive analyses of neural networks using PyTorch. The analyses cover various aspects such as weights, neuron activations, different epochs, optimizers, and initialization methods for different datasets.

The experiments and analysis were carried out for my university course CSE498R: Directed Research.
